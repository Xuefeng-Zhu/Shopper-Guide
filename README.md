## Overview 
When giving gifts, consumers usually keep in mind two variables - cost and quantity. In order to facilitate better gift-giving on the Zappos website, the Software Engineering team would like to test a simple application that allows a user to submit two inputs: N (desired # of products) and X (desired dollar amount). The application should take both inputs and leverage the Zappos API (http://developer.zappos.com/docs/api-documentation) to create a list of Zappos products whose combined values match as closely as possible to X dollars. For example, if a user entered 3 (# of products) and $150, the application would print combinations of 3 product items whose total value is closest to $150.
